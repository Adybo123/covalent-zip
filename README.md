# Covalent Zip

*A React web-based zip client*

Create, compress, and download newly created zip files, explore, preview and download files from existing zip files (without downloading the whole thing), and restructure/upload files to existing zip files before re-compressing and downloading them... all in the browser, and all client side with a React frontend!
